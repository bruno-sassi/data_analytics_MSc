    "### Step 14: Analyze Complaint Types Across Boroughs with a Pivot Table\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize and compare complaint volumes across boroughs and types, we use a **pivot table**. Pivot tables are used when you want to **summarize grouped data** in a 2D format for easy comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a pivot table?\n",
    "A pivot table reshapes data:\n",
    "- **Rows (`index`)** represent categories you want to group by (e.g., `Borough Code`).\n",
    "- **Columns (`columns`)** represent subcategories (e.g., `Complaint Type`).\n",
    "- **Values (`values`)** are the numbers you want to compute (e.g., count of complaints).\n",
    "- **aggfunc** defines what to compute: `count`, `sum`, `mean`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  In this case:\n",
    "- We group complaints by **borough code**.\n",
    "- For each borough, we count the number of complaints of each **type**.\n",
    "- We use `fill_value=0` to replace missing combinations with zero (no complaints of that type)."
